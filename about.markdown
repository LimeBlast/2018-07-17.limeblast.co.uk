This site exists as a repository of my thoughts, and contains posts on whatever takes my interest.

The phrase used in the sub-title of this page used to prepend the word "developer" with the word "Web", but in recent years I've started to breaking out of my comfort zone, and have started building non-web things such as apps and games.

With this in mind, a lot of the content here is likely to be technical, but not exclusively so as I may discuss my interest in gaming, outdoor activates, and my more recent interest in fitness (and using technology to improve it).

For more information about my professional self, I keep an online curriculum vitae which you can read over at [My Name is Daniel](http://danielhollands.co.uk/).
