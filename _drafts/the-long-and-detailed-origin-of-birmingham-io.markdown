In early-to-mid-2014, after having lived in Birmingham for just under a year, I started to get involved in the local tech meet-up scene.

The first such *meet* I attended was [HydraHack](http://hydrahack.co.uk/). This event, hosted at The Church in the Jewelry Quarter, consisted of free curry and a drink, presentations on interesting techie subjects, and networking. I was invited by someone, who, like myself, didn't fancy the prospect of attending an event full of strangers alone, so we went as each other's backup. Although I didn't know it at the time, this was the first time I encoutered [@sil](https://twitter.com/sil).

I think it was another three months or so before I attended anything else, but spurred on by the success of not dying of human contact at HydraHack, a chance email from meetup.com prompted me to attend the first [Open Code](http://www.meetup.com/Birmingham-Open-Code/) meet. Like HydraHack, I went with backup, but unlike HydraHack, my choice of backup wasn't a techie - so I imagine that all fun I had chatting with other geeks was matched with equal levels of boredom on his behalf.

He did he a solid though, as I honestly don't think I would have attended without him, and being a member of Open Code is one of the main influences behind starting the community.

I quickly discovered that Birmingham was brimming with tech groups, and that not a single week went by without an interesting event. Events attended by people with a real passion for tech. Passion enough to spend their own time and energy persuing their trade, rather than turning it off outside the hours of 9-to-5.

I joined more groups, specifically:

- [West Midlands Ruby User Group](http://www.meetup.com/West-Midlands-Ruby-User-Group-WMRUG/)
- [brum.js](https://plus.google.com/communities/101900854499046705651)
- [Silicon Canal Drinks](http://www.meetup.com/Brum-Tech-Drinks/)
- [Tech Wednesday](http://www.meetup.com/tech-wednesday/)

The more of these events I attended, the more I realised that the degrees of separation between the members of the tech scene in Birmingham was very low. Even if the paths of two people didn't cross via one group, they almost certainly would via another. This made it easy for me to confidently attend new events, as I had a high level of confidence that I'd know at least one person at said event.

"This is great and all" I hear you thinking, "but what does any of this have to do with birmingham.io?"

As mentioned above, being part of Open Code was one of the main infulances behind the community, as it was during an Open Code meet that I discovered [Marvel had released a developer API](http://developer.marvel.com/). This is a tool which gaves access to information about their back catalogue of comics, and I was desperate to do something cool with it.

The problem is I didn't know what I wanted to do, just that *something* had to be done. I'd spoken with some of the other attendees of the meet, and together we threw around some initial ideas, then decided to use the meetup.com comments system to plan something.

Unfortunatly, we quickly discovered this was a poor system for the purpose. The meetup.com comment system is an excellent tool for informing people that you're running 5 minutes late to a meet, but that's about it.

So obviouly, the next step was to find whatever community forum that all the techies in the city used. I mean, there had to be one, right?

Right?

So I asked around, did some Googling, but ultimatly discovered that no such thing existed, so decided to solve the problem myself, with the result being birmingham.io.

The site has gone though a few changes since it first launched, and will continue to do so into the future,
