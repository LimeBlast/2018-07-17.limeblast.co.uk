The community site [birmingham.io](http://birmingham.io/) was born out of selfishness - let me tell you why.

In mid-2014, after having lived in Birmingham for just under a year, I started to get involved in the local tech meet-up scene. The first such *meet* I attended was [HydraHack](http://hydrahack.co.uk/) at The Church in the Jewelry Quarter. It took another three months for me to start regularly attending things like [Open Code](http://www.meetup.com/Birmingham-Open-Code/), the [West Midlands Ruby User Group](http://www.meetup.com/West-Midlands-Ruby-User-Group-WMRUG/), and many of the other such groups, but it wasn't long before I felt at home with the people I met through these groups.

The more of these events I attended, the more I realised that the degrees of separation between the members of the tech scene in Birmingham was very low, and even if two people's paths didn't cross via, say [brum.js](https://plus.google.com/communities/101900854499046705651), they almost certinally would via another one, such as [Silicon Canal Drinks](http://www.meetup.com/Brum-Tech-Drinks/) or [Tech Wednesday](http://www.meetup.com/tech-wednesday/).

Anyway, getting to the selfish part of the story, at around the same time as I was feeling welcomed by these groups, [Marvel released a developer API](http://developer.marvel.com/) that gave access to information about their back catalogue of comics, and I was desperate to do something cool with it.

The problem is I didn't know what I wanted to do, just that *something* had to be done. So I started to use the meetup.com comments system in an attempt to plan something, but quickly found it lacking. It was an excellent tool for informing people that you're running 5 minutes late, but that's about it.
