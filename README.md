# Lime Blast Blog

The official repo for the GitHub Pages hosted [Lime Blast Blog](http://limeblast.co.uk).

## Local development
- Clone the repo
- run `bundle install`
- run `npm install`
- run `gulp`

## Images
I've used [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/editor/) to edit the featured images:

- Position and crop to 1900x872 pixels.
- Applied Filter -> Mimic HDR.
- Knocked brightness down by about 30.
- Saved with a JPG compression of about 40%, in an effort to get the file size under 200kbs.
- Passed them through [compress jpeg](http://compressjpeg.com/).
